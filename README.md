Cooking Recommendations

### Overview
Cooking is both a passion and a big concern for some people. Cooking, on the other hand, can always use a helping hand. Being a student, deciding what to eat for lunch or dinner is always a challenge. When you only have a few ingredients in the kitchen, deciding what to make for dinner might be difficult. This prompted us to develop a system that can suggest recipes based on suggested ingredients. Recipe provider that uses web-scraped recipe data to provide users with the recipes based on their preferences and the ingredients they have.

### Goals
1. Create a search algorithm that utilizes similarity scoring to rank recipes according to the greatest similarity to the search query.
2. To provide recipes when the user has limited items in the kitchen, or cannot decide what to cook for his/meal.
3. Recommend recipes based on the dish name
4. Recommend recipes based on the ingredients the user has with him/her.
